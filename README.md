# mvtools.lua
This script is a fork of nand's "mvtools.vpy" and maoiscat's "mvtools_3.py" script featured in the awesome-mpv script compilation. This script retains the integrity of the frame rate conversion option found in the original script while using maoiscat's logical operations.

※Remember to change the file extension in your mpv.conf vapoursynth directory. Example: vf=vapoursynth="C:\Users\<USERNAME>\AppData\Roaming\mpv\scripts\mvtools.lua"
